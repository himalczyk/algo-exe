"""Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

find_needle(['hay', 'junk', 'hay', 'hay', 'moreJunk', 'needle', 'randomJunk'])
should return "found the needle at position 5" (in COBOL "found the needle at position 6")"""

def find_needle(haystack):
    for idx, value in enumerate(haystack):
        if value == "needle":
            return f'found the needle at position {idx}'
